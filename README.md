# Dynamic Publication Media

Dynamically published documents (instead of static ones like books and papers) offer a wide range of advantages.
You can interact with them, or they are created dynamically, with code.

We wanted to focus on three different main applications for these documents: **Documentation**, **Teaching** and **Science Communication**.
The documents provided for this paper are found on this page.

# Dynamic Documents with CoRC

**CoRC** is a high-level binding of COPASI to the statistical programming language **R** (for more information look at the [CoRC](https://jpahle.github.io/DynamiCoRC/corc.html) tab).
The combination of CoRC with dynamic documents allows for easy interaction with complex models, both in the creation and handling.
Newcomers and advanced creators alike can benefit from portraying  code with dynamic documents.

# Dynamic Document Creation

Most of the files here are created using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
It is a markdown language that is easy to use and can be very powerful in combination with for example [shiny applications](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) or [flexdashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/).

Jupyter notebooks are another popular form of dynamic documents with many similar capabilities but some differences in structure.

# Dynamic Hosting options

There are a lot of hosting options for dynamic documents.
Most of the files created and used here are hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
While very easy to use, all the websites hosted there are static.

In addition, one document is hosted on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
Here, it is possible to code online, within the document.

The more dynamic R Markdown documents, like shiny apps and flexdashboards are hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).
