This website supplements the paper on dynamic publications with CoRC. You can read the paper [here](TODO) but the documents on this page work also without the context given there.

# Dynamic Publication Media

Dynamicly published documents (instead of static ones like books and papers) offer a wide range of advantages. 
We wanted to focus on three different main applications for these documents: **Documentation**, **Teaching** and **Science Communication**.
The documents provided for this paper are found on this page.

# CoRC

If you want to learn about CoRC, you can do so [here](https://jpahle.github.io/DynamicPublicationMediaManuscript/corc.html)
If you want to start with coding right away, you can use our beginner friendly document on [opimization](https://jpahle.github.io/DynamicPublicationMediaManuscript/optimization.html)
If you are already familiar with COPASI and model building and want to see what CoRC can do, look at our example on [Parallel Processing](https://jpahle.github.io/DynamicPublicationMediaManuscript/parallel.html).
